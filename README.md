ThornOS owes much to the following sources:

- [Philipp Oppermann's Blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/). Without this blog ThornOS would never have been started
- [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity). For showing it's possible to build it all from scratch & for all of Andreas' amazingly helpful youtube videos
